# LIBRARY SYSTEM - FINAL PROJECT 3650

This project aims to create an online library system that provides streamlined services for students and library staff. Students can look up materials, create a book borrowing order, renew, and return books through our system. Meanwhile, staff can manage the book catalog and process students' orders.
